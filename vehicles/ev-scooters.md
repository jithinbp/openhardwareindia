# EV Scooters

A big frustration with EV scooters is that they are being built and sold like iphones. Batteries are not removable, firmware is closed-source and third-party repair is being killed.

DIY is not possible when it comes to vehicles because of regulations. What can make a difference here is for buyers to organize and demand changes from manufacturers. Businesses do listen to \$$.
