# Repair Tools & Resources

## Crowdsourced Repair Map for India

We are collectively building [a curated map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1cixlIAtcnax3OUIfCYN7BihHqoi0698\&ehbc=2E312F) of repair vendors and hardware stores for all of India. This is similar to RepairCafe's maps but those are not open to public contribution. To add new places to this map, please contact us in our whatsapp community.

You will find a lot of useful material on the [Repair Wiki](https://repair.wiki/), either for a specific product or [general electronics repair advice](https://repair.wiki/w/Category:Repair_Basics) for things like Capacitors, Inductors, Diodes etc. You should also check if [iFixit](https://ifixit.com) has a repair guide for your specific product. There are other potentially helpful sources like [https://caps.wiki](https://caps.wiki/wiki/Main_Page).
