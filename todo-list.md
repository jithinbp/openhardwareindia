# TODO List

* [ ] Improve wiki for all categories
* [ ] Write a page about how to [buy things from international vendors](buying-internationally.md) via dropshippers and deal with customs duties
* [ ] Compile a comprehensive [scoring formula](scoring-formula.md) for manufacturers (similar to iFixit's score but more relevant for Indian buyers)
* [ ] Finalize a domain name
* [ ] Identify experts for each product category to moderate the wiki page and coordinate further research
