•⁠ ⁠The wiki now has a permanent web address: [https://www.isfixable.com/](https://www.isfixable.com/) \
•⁠ ⁠⁠There are 3 ways to contribute to the wiki: \
&#x20;   (1) Submit this Google Form: [https://www.isfixable.com/suggest-improvements](https://www.isfixable.com/suggest-improvements) \
&#x20;   (2) Submit a pull request on our Github repo: [https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/fixable](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/fixable) \
&#x20;   (3) Edit via the Gitbook app: [https://app.gitbook.com/](https://app.gitbook.com/) (DM me your email address if you’d like to get this access)

•⁠ ⁠There is now a form on the site where you can express buying interest for better products. Please consider filling this form. This can become a useful signal for hardware entrepreneurs to improve their products’ repairability: [https://www.isfixable.com/express-buying-interest](https://www.isfixable.com/express-buying-interest) \
•⁠ ⁠⁠We are also crowdsourcing an all-India map of repair service providers and hardware stores. Please help improve it for your own city: [https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1cixlIAtcnax3OUIfCYN7BihHqoi0698\&usp=sharing](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1cixlIAtcnax3OUIfCYN7BihHqoi0698\&usp=sharing) \
•⁠ ⁠⁠We now have city-wise groups for Delhi/NCR, Chennai, Kochi and Bangalore. I’m happy to create groups for any other city as long as at least 3 people from there are present and active.

•⁠ ⁠I (Nilesh) am planning to speak about this wiki at the upcoming Barcamp Bangalore Unconference (8th March, Church Street). Please come to express support if possible: [https://barcampbangalore.com/bcb/bcb-2025/technology-bcb-2025/a-wiki-for-repair-friendly-hardware-products-in-india](https://barcampbangalore.com/bcb/bcb-2025/technology-bcb-2025/a-wiki-for-repair-friendly-hardware-products-in-india)

There is still a lot of work to be done: \
•⁠ ⁠⁠Improve the wiki. \
•⁠ ⁠Help build a consumer rights / repair / DIY-er community for your city using this site’s resources. \
•⁠ ⁠⁠Spread the word. Tell your local repair experts, or your fav youtube creators about this project.

If you have other ideas to make this project successful, please start a conversation in the Fixable :: General group on whatsapp.

Thank you for getting this community started. As for the next steps for all of us:

•⁠ ⁠We need to encourage youtuber creators to talk about repair-friendliness of the products they review. Whenever you watch a gadget review on YouTube, please add a comment asking them to talk about this aspect.&#x20;

•⁠ ⁠We need to bring product repair experts to this community. Their interests are highly aligned to ours. Please tell your local repair shop guy (anywhere in India) to join this WhatsApp community.&#x20;

•⁠ ⁠Start systematic evaluation of products on our repair-friendliness score. This will require expert contribution so the previous step becomes even more important.&#x20;

•⁠ ⁠Indicate to hardware makers that demand exists for better products. Perhaps on each category, we can collect interest and present it as "6525 people want to buy a repairable water purifier"
