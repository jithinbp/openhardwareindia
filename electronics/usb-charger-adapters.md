# USB Charger-Adapters

While iFixit sells [this open schematics 65W GaN charger](https://www.ifixit.com/products/ifixit-65w-usb-c-ac-adapter) in the US, no such thing is available in India (remember we have different power socket standard and our household AC voltage is 220V, and not 110V).

By the way, did you know there are 5 different protocols to supply power via USB cables?

[Metrix Instruments](https://www.metrixinstrument.in/products/usb-testers) builds and sells some useful USB testers in India. This can be a good alternative to [Power-Z testers](https://www.power-z.com/product_cat/tester) which can be difficult to find in or order from India.

The [ChargerLab YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ChargerLAB) does detailed teardowns and testing of various USB chargers which you might find helpful.
