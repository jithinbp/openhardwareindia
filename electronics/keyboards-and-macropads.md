# Keyboards & Macropads

## Keyboards

Computing enthusiasts are usually very passionate about their choice of keyboards. Here are some keyboard-related communities in India where you will find detailed information and strong opinions:

* [subreddit for mechanical keyboards in India](https://old.reddit.com/r/mkindia/) (here's their [intro doc](https://old.reddit.com/r/mkindia/wiki/index))
* [IMKC (Indian Mechanical Keyboard Community) on Discord](https://discord.gg/PFKsdzes8x)

[curated list](https://keebfolio.netlify.app/) of Open Source Mechanical Keyboard resources

A good idea might be to check if the keyboard you are considering runs the [QMK open-source firmware](https://qmk.fm/) or [VIA firmware](https://www.caniusevia.com/). Here is [QMK's keyboard directory](https://browse.qmk.fm/) and [here is VIA's](https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/supported_keyboards).

There is this other keyboard firmware, ZMK, but they [list only supported controller boards](https://zmk.dev/docs/hardware), not final products.

There are many, many choices (because mechanical or not, RGB or not, split/ergonomic or not etc) for repairable keyboards (like [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) split ergonomic keyboard), so a key factor might be to check if it is easy to acquire in India. Importing from outside India usually involves hassles around customs duties.
