Check out [Bootloader Unlock : Wall of Shame](https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame)

You should check if the phone you are about to buy supports one of the following operating systems:

* [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/)
* [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices)
* [PostmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices)&#x20;

These devices seem good (though some are not available for sale in India so you'd have to get them from abroad somehow):

* [HMD Fusion](https://www.hmd.com/en_in/hmd-fusion?sku=101SQ503H034-gaming-flashyindigoblue). They [seem to be](https://www.hmd.com/en_in/self-repair) supportive of self-repair, even for other models like Crest 5G. But they do not allow bootloader unlocking.
* [PinePhone and PinePhone Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinephone/)
* [Fairphone](https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-5)
* [Mecha Comet](https://mecha.so/comet) (coming to Kickstarter in Q1 2025) - a handheld Linux computer in a smartphone-style form factor with several extensible attachments via GPIO
