# Smartphones

The key decision you need to make here is which operating system you want to run. There are just 3 choices currently:

* **iOS** : This is completely closed and you should give up any hopes of a repair-friendly iPhone until Apple is forced by Right To Repair regulations (like they were in the EU).
* **Android** : While Google does maintain the [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/), this is not directly usable by most users. Instead you should look for devices supported by [LineageOS](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/), [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/faq#supported-devices) or [CaylixOS](https://calyxos.org/). First thing to check here is whether your device supports unlocking of the bootloader at the [Bootloader Unlock : Wall of Shame](https://github.com/melontini/bootloader-unlock-wall-of-shame). The current set of decent devices are:
  * [Fairphone](https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-5) (does not ship to India)
  * [HMD Fusion](https://www.hmd.com/en_in/hmd-fusion?sku=101SQ503H034-gaming-flashyindigoblue). They [seem to be](https://www.hmd.com/en_in/self-repair) supportive of self-repair, even for other models like Crest 5G. But they do not allow bootloader unlocking.

  * Failing all, a pragmatic option might be to get Google Pixel phone which supports LineageOS and GrapheneOS well.
  * Custom Android Verified Boot keys is a feature which allows you to run a custom OS with a locked bootloader. It's rare to see a device which supports custom AVB keys, but some devices can be found [here](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot/issues/299).
  * Sony has an Open Devices program supporting AOSP for its xperia smartphones, but Sony [exited the smartphones category of India in 2019](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/12-smartphone-brands-that-have-exited-india-market-in-the-last-decade/articleshow/107976381.cms) and are unlikely to return.
* **Linux** : Though Android too is based on Linux, some people prefer to avoid Android ecosystem altogether. The OS comes in many variants like Debian, Ubuntu Touch or [PostmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices). Check out the following devices:
  * [PinePhone and PinePhone Pro](https://pine64.org/devices/pinephone/)
  * [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/)
  * [Mecha Comet](https://mecha.so/comet) (coming to Kickstarter in Q1 2025) - a handheld Linux computer in a smartphone-style form factor with several extensible attachments via GPIO
