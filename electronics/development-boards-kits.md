* [https://csparkresearch.in/kuttypyplus](https://csparkresearch.in/kuttypyplus) is an ATMEGA32 trainer which can be used for data collection/device control via a Python/Android interface which have real-time access to HW registers.


## KuttypyPlus

![](kuttypyplusheader.jpg)

Software - Real World bridge for learning embedded systems. The kuttyPy (/kʊtipʌɪ/) Microcontroller training software allows live manipulation of the registers in the ATMEGA32 on the KuttyPy board via a connected computer through a Python library or Graphical interface. The software has a built in IDE, A visual coding interface, and even AI tools for gesture recognition. It has live debugging and monitoring tools, and combined with the connected phone/laptop's visualization and analytical utilities, this approach has immense pedagogical potential for beginners to the microcontroller world.

The Python library, GUI, firmware, and KiCAD schematics are open source.
