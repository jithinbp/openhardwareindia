# Monitors / TVs

For TVs, we want the longest warranty period and lack of any "smart" features.&#x20;

One solution here seems to be to buy commercial displays from Sharp/NEC and add the software smartness via a Raspberry Pi. [Here's Jeff Geerling's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-epPf7D8oMk) about this approach. [NEC has a good catalog](https://in.nec.com/en_IN/solutions_services/display_solutions/large_format_displays/index.html) of such displays in India. Sharp even f[launts their open-source approach](https://www.sharpnecdisplays.us/system-on-a-chip).
