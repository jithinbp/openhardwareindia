# Scoring Formula

To provide a repair-friendliness score for various products, we should evaluate them on the following:

* Does the product have better-than-average warranty period for its segment?
* Has the manufacturer registered on Indian Government's [Right To Repair portal](https://righttorepairindia.gov.in/)?
* Are the repair manuals available to public without any cost?
* Does the manufacturer sell replacement parts for the product?
* Is the product made of standardized parts which can be bought from other vendors?
* is the product available for direct purchase in India (without having to import it and going through customs) ?
* Does the manufacturer provide repair services in India?
* Is the product made or assembled in India?
* Are the product schematics, firmware source code and CAD designs available as open-source?
