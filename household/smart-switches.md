# Smart Switches

Instead of getting a smart bulb, or a smart fan etc, it might be better to buy a smart plug/switch instead which can be controlled over wifi. However, these days even these smart switches have started sending data to cloud servers.

One possible solution here is open-source firmware like [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/About/).
