> Often not- depending on your use case. The use of centrifugal fans allows for more pressure than radial fans but at the cost of far more noise. Manufacturers often deceptively list the highest CADR their product can achieve but at its average or lowest noise levels. By using arrays of repurposed radial PC fans, we can make up the pressure- with far less noise. Those fans can also easily and inexpensively be replaced as needed.
