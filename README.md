# Open Hardware for India

### [Join our WhatsApp Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/HVEhZzP3Y0RDZbUMsh37Ro)

Are you sick and tired of consumer hardware products that has a short life, is needlessly bundled with "smart" (but actually insecure and non-open software), is impossible to repair, is poorly designed and is made of parts that cannot be reused? Have you too been radicalized by the ["Buy Now" documentary on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81554996)?&#x20;

This site is our attempt to document various resources (like open hardware products, consumer-friendly brands, repair or [part providers](https://findparts.in/) etc) across various product categories - specifically for India.

We have the following criteria for listing products on this site:

* Better than industry-average warranty period
* Third-party repair permitted and enabled (via availability of parts and manuals)
* Modular design for reusability of parts
* Preferably made in India for better product availability (i.e. no custom duty hassles) and service /support
* Open-source schematics, code and CAD designs (like how [Framework](https://frame.work/) does it)

This is a wiki for _buyers_ in India, not _DIYers_. DIY (Doing-It-Yourself) is our least preferred option, though still better than being forced to buy bad products currently prevalent in the market. Over time, we hope to build a strong community and [influence OEMs and policies](https://righttorepairindia.gov.in/) by voting with our â‚¹,  speech and votes. We would like to see _Framework_ like companies in each of these product categories.
