# Open Hardware for India

### [Contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/nileshtrivedi/openhardwareindia/)

Are you sick and tired of consumer hardware products that has a short life, is needlessly bundled with "smart" (but actually insecure and non-open software), is impossible to repair, is poorly designed and is made of parts that cannot be reused? Have you too been radicalized by the ["Buy Now" documentary on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81554996)?&#x20;

This site is our attempt to document various resources (like open hardware products, consumer-friendly brands, repair or [part providers](https://findparts.in/) etc) across various product categories - specifically for India.

We have the following criteria for listing products on this site:

* Better than industry-average warranty period
* Third-party repair permitted and enabled (via availability of parts and manuals)
* Modular design for reusability of parts
* Preferably made in India for better product availability (i.e. no custom duty hassles) and service /support
* Open-source schematics, code and CAD designs (like how [Framework](https://frame.work/) does it)

There are other initiatives like:

* [Repair Wiki](https://repair.wiki/) and [Consumer Action Task Force](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/) wiki by [YouTuber Louis Rossmann](https://www.youtube.com/@rossmanngroup)
* [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) which is famous for their teardowns and repairability ratings
* OSHWA.org who tries to certify open-source hardware products (they have about [60 open-source hardware projects listed from India](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html)).&#x20;
* [https://caps.wiki](https://caps.wiki/wiki/Main_Page)/

We intend our wiki to be even more helpful to Indian consumers. Over time, we hope to build a strong community and [influence OEMs and policies](https://righttorepairindia.gov.in/) by voting with our â‚¹,  speech and votes. We would like to see _Framework_ like companies in each of these product categories.
